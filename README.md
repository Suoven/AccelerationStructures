# AccelerationStructures
Three different demos of acceleration structures like an Octree for collision resolution, a Bounding Volume Hierarchy and a KD-tree for ray tracing

# Octree
With this acceleration structure we can vary the size of the octree and accomplish a media of 600 intersection test for every frame, while
with a brute force approach we make more than 20k intersection test each frame.
